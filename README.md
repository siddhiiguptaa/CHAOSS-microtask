Microtasks
For becoming familiar with Augur, you can start by reading some documentation. 
Once you're familiar with Augur, you can have a look at the following microtasks.

Microtask 0:
Download and configure Augur, creating a dev environment using the general cautions noted here:

Augur
https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/getting-started/installation.html and the full documentation here:
https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/development-guide/toc.html

Progress: I am finding in setting up a virtual environment on my Windows laptop. My idea is to get familiar through resources present on the web and install Augur 1-2 days before submitting the application. 

Microstask 1:
Work on any Augur or Grimoirelab Issue that's Open

Progress: As a beginner, I am looking for good first issues that involve some coding related problem solving skills. 

Microtask 2:
Identify new issues you encounter during installation.

Progress: Mainly in the documentation till now! 
1) It is confusing to understand what all tools I need before hand to install Augur. 
2) CHAOSS can work on adding in the documentation how to solve common errors that contributors face during installation. 

Microstask 3:
Explore data presently captured, develop an experimental visualization using tools of your choice. If Jupyter Notebooks against an Augur database/API endpoint collection, use https://github.com/chaoss/augur-community-reports for development.

Progress: I am currently exploring the data captured. 

Microtask 4:
Anything you want to show us. Even if you find bugs in our documentation and want to issue a PR for those!

Progress: I have found a lot of errors in the consistency of the website, and the links provided there:
